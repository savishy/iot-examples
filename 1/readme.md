## What you need

You obviously need a functional Raspberry Pi with an internet connection.
_This code has been tested on Raspberry Pi Model B, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B_.


## Hardware

Apart from that you need the following hardware

1. LED
1. 330 Ohm Resistor
1. Breadboard
1. Jumper wires to connect GPIO to breadboard. [Here's an example from Amazon of the types I used](https://www.amazon.in/Jumper-Wires-Male-female-Pieces/dp/B00ZYFX6A2/).

## Raspberry Pi Setup

This code uses:

1. 3rd pin in top row: `Ground` connection to breadboard
1. 8th pin in top row (pin 23): `Power` connection to breadboard

Keep the GPIO diagram handy:

## Notes

The _same_ code can be used to drive a buzzer!
